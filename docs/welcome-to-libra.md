## Overview

Welcome to the **Libra Ecosystem**! 

The Libra vision is: *a simple, borderless, global currency, and financial ecosystem, that empowers billions of people.*

We have just launched a **TestNet** for community feedback. The TestNet is a live demonstration of the Libra project. **Libra Core** is an open-source software that runs the TestNet. Libra Core enables you to:

* Interact with the TestNet.
* Run an instance of the Libra Blockchain on your machine. 

This project is at an early prototype stage. We are interested in hearing what you think. To know more about the project goals and context refer to the  [Libra white-paper](https://fb.quip.com/SYVOA7To9KSW). 

This technical walkthrough of the Libra project introduces you to:

* The Libra Protocol.
* The lifecycle of a transaction on the Libra Blockchain.
* The Move programming language. 
* The modules of Libra Core.

## Libra

**Libra** is a global** **reserve-backed** **currency at the heart of the Libra project. The **Libra Blockchain** is a software system for managing a distributed ledger. The primary motivation for creating the Libra Core software is to manage the public **Libra Ledger**. Libra Ledger is a globally accessible decentralized system.  It maintains the balance of Libra Currency. 

## Libra Ecosystem

The participants of the Libra Ecosystem are:

### Clients

Clients are external entities like exchanges and wallets, that enable the end-users to interact with the Libra Blockchain. Clients can:

* Construct, sign, and submit transactions.
* Read information about accounts and transactions.

### Validators

Validators decide which transactions will be added to the Libra Blockchain in which order.

### Developers

* Contribute to Libra Core software.
* Write software to interact with Libra Core modules.

### End-Users

End-users use clients to:

* Construct and submit transactions to the Libra Blockchain.
* Read information about accounts and transactions from the Libra Blockchain.

## Move

Move is a new programming language that was developed to provide a safe and programmable foundation for the Libra Blockchain. The most important goals of Move are:

* Express Libra, the core currency.
* Express the rules of governing Libra.
* Execute the rules of governing Libra in a precise, understandable, and verifiable manner.

Before you execute your first transaction on the Libra Blockchain, let us first understand fundamentals of the Libra Protocol.
