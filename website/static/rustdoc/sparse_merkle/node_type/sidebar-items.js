The introduction of branch node could benefit IOPS of querying a tree by 4x since we compress 4 levels in standard merkle tree into 1 node.  Though we choose the same branch node structure as that of patricia merkle tree, the merkle proof has the same format as that of modified sparse merkle tree, the root hash computation logic is similar to a 4-level sparse merkle tree except some customizations. See the `CryptoHash` trait implementation below for details."],["ExtensionNode","Extension node is exactly the same as that in patricia merkle tree. It compresses a path without fork with a single node instead of multiple single-child branch nodes."],["LeafNode","Leaf node represents an account. It has two fields: key is the hash value of acccont adress and value_hash is the hash of account state blob."]]});
