## Reporting a Bug

The Libra team and community take all security bugs in the Libra project seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of Libra. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure. We will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing [security@libra.org](mailto:security@libra.org).

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email. After the initial reply to your report is sent, the security team will try to keep you informed on the progress towards a fix and a full announcement. The security team may ask you for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. The primary handler will coordinate the fix and release process which
involves the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases that are still under maintenance. 

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
