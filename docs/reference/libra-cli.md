## Overview

This guide describes how to use the Libra command line interface (CLI) client to interact with the Libra Blockchain. The CLI is invoked as an interactive shell. It provides basic commands to create accounts, mint coins, perform transfers, and query the blockchain. You can use the CLI client to interact with a validator node on the testnet, on a local Libra Blockchain, or on a remote blockchain, by specifying the node's hostname. 

## Invocation
To invoke the Libra CLI client use:

```rust
cargo run -p client --bin client -- [-a host] [-p port] [-f accounts] [-d debug_port]

```

### Options

The options for the `Cargo run` command are:

* `-m | --faucet_key_file_path` - The path to the generated keypair for the faucet account. Generated by generate_keypair. If not passed, a new keypair will be generated for you and placed in a temporary directory.
* `-f | --faucet_server` - The host that operates a faucet service. If not passed, this will be derived from the host parameter.
* `-a | —-host` - The destination host for CLI to connect with, the default value is `localhost`.
* `-p | -—port`- The public port of the destination Libra Blockchain for the client to connect with, the default value is 30307.
* `-n | --mnemonic_file` - The file location from which to load the mnemonic word for user account address/key generation. If not passed, a new mnemonic file is generated.
* `-s | --validator_set_file` - The file location from which to load the trusted peers config for the validator set.

### Commands

The CLI commands are in this format:

```rust
major_command sub_command [options]
```

If you enter only the major command, it will show the help information for that command. Major commands can be any one of the following:

 **`account | a`** -  Account related operations. Sub commands include:
 
  * `create | c` -  Create a random account with private/public key pair. Account information will be held in memory only. The created account will not be saved to chain.
  * `save | s` - Save all accounts information, including newly created ones, to file.
  * `load | l` - Load accounts from file.
  * `list | la`- Print all accounts that were created or loaded.
  * `<mint | m> | <mintb| mb>` - Mint coins to the account. Suffix 'b' is for blocking.
      * Usage:  `mint|mint|m|b <account_address_to>|<account_ref_id_to> <mint_balance>`. If blocking is specified (using suffix 'b'), CLI will query chain until the transaction is finalized/available. Same is true for other sub commands.
      * Arguments:
          * `account_address|account_reference_id` - The receiver account to mint the coins to. If the receiver account does not exist, it will be created first. Either `account_address` or `account_ref_id` (an internal index of the account in CLI) can be used to specify receiver account (same in other sub commands). The account that sent this mint transaction (currently preloaded genesis account) pays for the gas.
          * `mint_balance` - The balance of coin minted to the receiver account.
          
**`transfer | transferb | t | tb`** - Transfer coins from account to another. Suffix 'b' is for blocking.

* Usage: transfer | transferb | t | tb <sender_account_address>|<sender_account_ref_id> <receiver_account_address>|<receiver_account_ref_id> <number_of_coins>
* Arguments:
   * sender_account_address | sender_account_ref_id, the account to send this transfer transaction. The sender account pays the gas.
   * receive_account_address | receiver_account_ref_id, the account to which this transaction sends coins. If the receiver account does not exist, it will be created first and sender will pay the gas for both account creation and coin transfer.
      * number_of_coins, the number of coins transferred to receiver account.
        
**`query | q`** - Query data from destination chain. All query operations are blocking. Sub commands include:

  * **balance** | **b**     Get the current balance of an account
      * Usage: balance | b <account_ref_id>|<account_address>
      * Arguments:
          * account_ref_id|account_address, the account to query balance for.
          * assert_balance | a    Assert that balance is equal to the specified value, CLI will panic if the value from storage does not equal to expected value.
      * Usage: assert_balance | a <account_ref_id>|<account_address> <expected_value>
      * Arguments:
          * account_ref_id | account_address, the account to assert balance.
          * expected_value, expected value to assert to.
  * **sequence** | **s**    Get the current sequence number for an account.
        * Usage: sequence | s <account_ref_id>|<account_address>.
        * Arguments:
            * <account_ref_id>|<account_address> the account to get current/latest sequence number.
  * **account_state** | **as**   Get the latest state for an account.
        * Usage: account_state | as <account_ref_id>|<account_address>.
        * Arguments:
            * account_ref_id | account_address, the account to query latest state.
  * **txn_acc_seq** | **ts**     Get the committed transaction by account and sequence number.
        * Usage: txn_acc_seq | ts <account_ref_id>|<account_address> <sequence_number>
        * Arguments:
            * account_ref_id | account_address, the account to query committed transaction.
            * sequence_number, the sequence number of committed transaction.
  * **txn_range** | **tr**    Get the committed transaction by range
        * Usage: txn_range | tr <start_version> <limit>
        * Arguments:
            * start_version, the version to query the transaction from.
            * limit, the maximal number of transactions to query.
  * **event** | **ev**    Get event by account and path.
        * Usage: event | ev <account_ref_id>|<account_address> <path> <star_sequence_number> <ascending> <limit>.
        * Arguments:
            * account_ref_id | account_address, the account to query events.
            * path, the path of the events to query.
            * star_sequence_number, the sequence number of event to query from.
            * ascending, the direction of query from star_sequence_number.
            * limit, the maximal number of events to query.
* **quit** | **q!**, exit the CLI. No sub command is required.
* **help** | **h**, prints help. No sub command is required.
* **debug** | **d**, retrieve debug information. Sub commands include:
    * **metrics** | **metrics?** | **m** | **m?**,  Print node metrics. (? for json output)
    * **dump** | **d**, Dump node heap profile

### Account Creation/Mint(Faucet) for testnet

Account creation provided by the CLI generates a local keypair, but nothing is created on the blockchain. To create an account on the blockchain:

* Transfer coins to the address you wish to create. If the recipient account does not exist, the recipient account will be created first and then coins will be transferred. The sender pays for both account creation and transfer.
* Send a mint transaction to mint coins to an account. If the account does not exist, the account will be created first and the coins wil be minted later. Unlike other transactions, a non-existent account itself can request a mint transaction.  For the testnet, there is no explicit limit on how many coins an account can mint. It's designed to allow the users to create coins to experiment on the testnet.
