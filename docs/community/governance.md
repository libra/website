Over the past year, engineers from Facebook's Calibra team have designed a blockchain from the ground up to meet the needs of the Libra ecosystem. Facebook has consciously open sourced a prototype of Libra Core early so that the community can influence its direction. Facebook has irrevocably contributed its rights and code to the association under the terms of the Apache License and Apache Contributor License Agreement â€” just as any other contributor to Libra Core would. The development of Libra is now under the governance of the Libra Association.

Because Libra Core was open sourced early in its life, there remains much to build before the Libra Blockchain can be launched. Most open-source projects begin with a small set of core developers and a simple governance process, which allows the rapid development of the project in its early phases. The association is following this established practice and has asked Calibra to manage the evolution of Libra Core over the coming months.
